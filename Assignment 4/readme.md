#### (Accumulator, List Processing-III)

---

1. \*To find factorial N using accumulator.
2. To find length of a list using accumulator.
3. To remove duplicate elements from a list using accumulator.
4. \*To remove duplicate elements from a list without using accumulator.
5. \*To reverse a list using accumulator. For the problems 6 - 16 assume L is a list of terms.
6. \*has_duplicate(L), that determines whether list L has duplicate elements.
7. \*remove_every_other(L, L1) that is true if list L1 is just list L with every other element removed (the  wo lists should have the same first element).
8. \*cutlast(L, L1) that defines L1 to be obtained from L with last element removed.
9. \*trim(N, L, L1) that defines L1 to be obtained from L with first N elements removed.
10. \*trimlast(N, L, L1) defines that L1 to be obtained from L with last N elements removed.
11. \*exchange_first_last(L, L1), defines that L1 to be obtained from L with first and last elements exchanged. 
	That is, 
	?-exchange_first_last([a, b, c, d, e], X). 
	X= [e, b, c, d, a] 
12. \*circular_left_shift(L, L1). 
	That is, 
	if L= [a, b, c, d, e, f] 
	then L1= [b, c, d, e, f, a]
13. \*circular_right_shift(L, L1). 
	That is, 
	if L= [a, b, c, d, e, f] 
	then L1= [f, a, b, c, d, e]
14. \*To delete  he middle element from an odd-numbered list L into a list L1. 
15. \*To delete two middle elements from an even-numbered list L into a list L1.
16. \*unfold (L, L1) that reverses the elements of (an odd numbered) list L, from 1 to middle-1 elements and  iddle+1 to last element and store the result in L1. For the problems 17 – 18 assume L1, L2 and L denote lists of terms.
17. \*Interleave alternate elements of L1 and L2 into L. 
	For example, 
	if L1= [a, b, c] and L2= [1, 2], 
	then L =  a, 1, b, 2, c].
18. \*Transpose L1, L2 into L. 
	That is, 
	if L1= [a, b, c] and L2= [1, 2, 3], 
	then L= [(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3)]. 
19. \*Suppose that L1 and L2 are lists of numeric values. Find Inner product (L1, L2, X) that defines X to be inner product of two vectors L1, L2.
20. \*Define a predicate to “flatten” a list by constructing a list containing no lists as elements, but  ontaining all of the atoms of the original list. For example, consider the following goal and its  orresponding answer. 
	?- flatten ([a, [b, c], [[d], [ ], e]], L). 
	{L= [a, b, c, d, e]}


\*marked problems are not done in the class.
