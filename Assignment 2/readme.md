1. To find the sum of all elements of a list.
2. To find the length of a list.
3. \*To find the average of all elements of a list using sum and length defined in Problem 1 and 2.
4. To find the maximum number from a list.
5. \*To find gcd of two integers.
6. \*To generate all integers between two integers N1 and N2, both N1 and N2 included and N2>N1.
7. \*To count numbers greater than 100.0 in a list.
8. \*To split a list of numbers in two lists such that one contains negative numbers and other contains positive numbers. For the Problems 9 – 13, you can only assume increment by 1 (i. e., +1), decrement by 1 (i. e., -1) and any other predicate defined earlier in 9 – 12.
9. \*To recursively add two integers.
10. \*To subtract two integers recursively.
11. \* To multiply two integers recursively.
12. \*To divide two integers recursively and get the quotient.
13. \*To find the square root of an integer.
14. \* To find N!.
15. \*To generate first N Fibonacci numbers.
